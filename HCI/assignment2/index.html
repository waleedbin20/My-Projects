                        <h1>About Myself</h1>
                        <p>I am an operating partner at Khosla Ventures, working with portfolio companies to make their design and UX great. I build high performing teams, establish design practices, mentor and grow the next generation of great designers, and design interfaces and experiences. I drive strategic discussions at the highest levels of companies, focusing first on user needs to inspire product innovation.
                                As former head of the design teams for Google and Yahoo, I have been one of the biggest employers of UX talent. I have led design and user experience at Google, Yahoo, Netscape, and Udacity.
                                I was first introduced to yoga at the age of 16 and recommitted to my practice when my hectic career and passion for group exercise and fitness led me to pursue yoga for its many benefits. I draw on many styles of yoga, combining choreographed flow sequences with proper alignment to make yoga accessible yet challenging. My sequences are well-rounded, with a focus on safety, joining movement with breath, and having fun.

                                <p>Irene Au spent the majority of her career working to scale up large consumer internet companies. She began as an interaction designer at Netscape, 
                                    working on the first commercial web browser. Then in 1998, she joined Yahoo where she worked for eight years, leading the design team and introducing user-centered design practices. 
                                    She continued in a similar role when she went to Google in 2006 and was responsible for scaling the company’s design team to more than 250 members.
                                    At Yahoo, when I first joined, people thought of design as being really about aesthetics and making things look good,” she said. “And so I spent a lot of my time in the early days, explaining to people that design was not just about how things look, but how they work
